#     This is too often wrong to be useful. Models do not have objects members

# :W0212: *Access to a protected member %s of a client class*
#     Used when a protected member (i.e. class member with a name beginning
#     with an underscore) is access outside the class or a descendant of the
#     class where it's defined.
